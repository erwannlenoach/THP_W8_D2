Hi there !
You will find here the most awesome template ever
the thorough UI Kit can be found in the files 'template.html' (should be accessible through any web browser but don't be too hipsterish and stick to google chrome / mozilla firefox)
the different components of this kid are individually available in their respective file
Both internal CSS and bootstrap library CSS have been used to design this masterpiece (LOL)
Cheers,

Erwann
